# Metrics-Gated Canary & Blue/Green CI/CD Lab

An end-to-end project that demonstrates shipping safely with canary/blue-green, SLO-driven auto-rollback, and policy-gated IaC â€” all running locally via Docker.

## This lab is built to explore

- Progressive delivery with metrics gates

- CI/CD with tests, scans, policies, rollbacks, artifacts

- IaC-first, observable environments

- Clear runbooks, SLOs, postmortems

Run the whole demo in minutes on your laptop.
